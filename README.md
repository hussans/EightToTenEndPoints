**Description**: This API has three parts. The Magic 8 Ball gives random answers to questions. The Guess It game lets users guess a number with three difficulty levels: Easy (1-10), Medium (1-50), and Hard (1-100). The Restaurant Picker randomly chooses a restaurant from categories like Italian, Chinese, and Mexican. Each part includes basic checks to make sure the inputs are correct.
